Passionate about Computer Science since high school, I started to practice it with personal projects in the web domain. I pursued my passion by studying Computer Engineering with a specialization in **Intelligent Systems**.

Today I work as a **Software Engineer** in topics that interest me: **web development** and **mobile applications**.
